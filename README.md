In an era where social responsibility and philanthropy play pivotal roles in shaping societies for the better, the need for efficient and user-friendly Charity Management Systems is paramount. Our project endeavours to meet this need by developing a comprehensive platform tailored for Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) that empowers donors and recipients alike.

The Charity Management System is anchored by a dynamic and informative NGO website, serving as the primary interface between the organization and potential donors. This website not only provides detailed insights into the mission, values, and projects of the NGO but also facilitates seamless donation processes.

This comprehensive web platform facilitates seamless donations and appointment scheduling for NGOs, built with HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, and Postgres.

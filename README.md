In an era where social responsibility and philanthropy play pivotal roles in shaping societies for the better, the need for efficient and user-friendly Charity Management Systems is paramount. Our project endeavours to meet this need by developing a comprehensive platform tailored for Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) that empowers donors and recipients alike.

### Charity Management System (CMS)

#### Overview
Our project focuses on developing a user-friendly Charity Management System (CMS) that includes an NGO website. The website serves as a platform to provide information about the NGO and facilitates donations to support its charitable activities. 

#### How it Works
- **NGO Website**: The website's first page provides detailed information about the NGO and its mission.
- **Donation Process**: Visitors can click on the donate button, which redirects them to a donation page. Here, they provide personal details like name, email, contact number, and address.
- **Financial Contribution**: Donors can choose to contribute money on the same page. Upon clicking the donate button, they are redirected to a secure payment website.
- **Select Donation Types**: Donors can also choose the types of donations they want to make, such as clothing, utensils, food, or others.
- **Appointment Scheduling**: After selecting donation types, an appointment section is displayed where donors can schedule a donation appointment by selecting a date from the calendar.
- **Confirmation**: Once the donor confirms the appointment, a message saying "Thank you for donating" is displayed.

#### Example Usage
- A visitor lands on the NGO website and learns about their projects to provide education to underprivileged children.
- Inspired, the visitor clicks on the donate button, fills in their details, and decides to contribute $50 towards school supplies.
- They schedule a donation appointment for next week and receive a confirmation message.

#### Impact
The CMS streamlines the donation process, making it easier for donors to support charitable causes. For example, with the system in place, the NGO can efficiently collect donations for school supplies, ensuring that more children have access to education. This directly impacts the community by breaking the cycle of poverty and empowering individuals through education.
